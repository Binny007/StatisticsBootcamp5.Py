##Logistic Regression

--> In this session, we have dive deep into the concepts of Logistic Regression. This method is perfect for tackling classification proeblems where dependent or output variable is binary.

--> We are moving away from predicting continous outcomes, like purchase amounts or learning progress, and we are shifting our focus to event-based outcomes, such as whether someone made a purchase or someone found employment.

--> As we dive into this new problem solving, we will also need to adapt our analytical solution, and this is what we are going to cover as well, because we need to change how we measure accuracy. There are some changes when we have classification problems that we use Logistic Regression model, and we need to learn how to fine-tune, how to measure accuracy for our predictions.

--> We will also have a new way of interpreting coefficients, because this is very important for informed decision-making.

##Case Study

==> Moreover, we have a fun case study on predicting email spam. So, is the email that you are receiving are a spam or non spam? This is what you are going to predict.

==> So the dataset(spam.csv) has around 4601 email items, of which 1813 items were identified as spam. Our main goal is to look into the factors thatt characterize spam emails and use the power of Logistic Regression to predict them accurately.

      --> To help us, we have some fun predictors at our disposal such as the frequency of the word "money" in an email, because this could potentially signify a financial motive behind the message which is common            trait in spam emails.

      --> As well. the number of exclamation marks used and usually an excessive use of exclamation marks might indicate a sense of urgency or excitement which is something often eemployed by spammers to catch the            reader's attention.

==> This dataset provides us with a fantastic opportunity to show the effectiveness of Logistic Regression in predicting and exploring real-world applications.
